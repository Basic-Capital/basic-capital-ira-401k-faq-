## General Questions

### Who is a good fit for Basic Capital?

Basic Capital is built for long-term investors seeking broad market exposure and tax-advantaged growth. The financing is designed to remain in place for the duration of your investment and does not require scheduled repayment, allowing you to stay focused on long-term compounding.

### Is Basic Capital available outside of an IRA or 401(k)?

No, Basic Capital is designed for long-term investing. As a result it is exclusively offered within an IRA or 401(k) to maximize tax efficiency for long-term investors.

### How is Basic Capital different from a margin loan?

Basic Capital is not a margin loan but it is important to understand how Basic Capital financing differs from traditional margin lending.

Basic Capital offers $4 of financing for every $1 you contribute, but only on eligible assets â€“ broad market stocks and bonds intended to be held for the long-term. The financing is also long-term, and not subject to mark-to-market liquidation.

Alternatively, margin loans are extended on a 2:1 basis, $2 dollars of assets for every $1 of equity, and have constant mark-to-market risk. If the value of your assets drop, your account can be liquidated.

Margin rates are between 4.50-6% and brokers typically do not restrict which assets you can purchase. Margin provides relatively low cost of financing and investing flexibility, but with limited investment power and the risk of forced liquidation.

Basic Capital financing is currently 6.25% and can only be secured with eligible assets, but provides substantially more investing power without the risk of marked-to-market liquidation.

### What assets are eligible for Basic Capital financing?

Basic Capital is restricted to broad market ETFs and mutual funds investing in stocks and bonds across major developed markets (including the US, Europe, Japan, Australia, and Canada), and REITs. As a result, Basic Capital is most appropriate for investors looking to implement a long-term, broad market portfolio.

### What is the minimum investment amount?

The minimum investment amount is $5,000. This allows you to access Basic Capital's financing structure while maintaining cost-effectiveness for smaller investors.

### How does Basic Capital make money?

Basic Capital charges a financing fee of 6.25% annually on the amount of financing provided. This fee is competitive with traditional margin lending while offering superior investment leverage and no mark-to-market liquidation risk.

### Can I withdraw my money at any time?

Yes, you can withdraw your contributions at any time without penalty. However, withdrawals may be subject to IRA or 401(k) rules and potential tax implications depending on your account type and age.

### What happens if the market goes down?

Unlike margin accounts, Basic Capital financing does not require mark-to-market maintenance or forced liquidation. Your investment can experience market volatility without triggering automatic selling, allowing you to maintain your long-term investment strategy.

### Is Basic Capital FDIC insured?

Basic Capital investments are not FDIC insured, as they consist of market securities (ETFs and mutual funds). However, securities are held in custody accounts with SIPC protection up to $500,000 per account.

### How do I get started with Basic Capital?

To get started, you'll need an eligible IRA or 401(k) account. Contact Basic Capital to discuss your investment goals and determine if the platform is right for your situation. The onboarding process typically takes 5-10 business days.

### What are the tax implications?

Since Basic Capital operates exclusively within IRAs and 401(k)s, your investments benefit from tax-advantaged growth. Traditional IRA/401(k) contributions are tax-deductible, while Roth versions offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### Can I use Basic Capital with an existing IRA?

Yes, you can transfer or rollover funds from existing IRAs to access Basic Capital financing. The process is handled through direct trustee-to-trustee transfers to avoid tax consequences.

## For Individual Investors

### How much can I contribute annually?

Individual contribution limits follow IRA guidelines: $7,000 annually for 2025 (or $8,000 if age 50+). With Basic Capital's 4:1 financing, your $7,000 contribution provides $35,000 in total investment power.

### What investment options do I have?

You can invest in broad market ETFs and mutual funds covering US stocks, international developed markets, bonds, and REITs. Popular options include total market index funds, S&P 500 ETFs, international equity funds, and bond index funds.

### Can I change my investment allocation?

Yes, you can rebalance your portfolio periodically. However, all changes must comply with Basic Capital's eligible asset requirements focusing on broad market exposure rather than individual stocks or sector-specific investments.

### What fees will I pay?

You'll pay Basic Capital's 6.25% annual financing fee plus the expense ratios of your chosen ETFs/mutual funds (typically 0.03% to 0.20% for broad market index funds). No additional account maintenance fees apply.

### How does Basic Capital affect my retirement planning?

Basic Capital can potentially accelerate your retirement savings by providing 4x investment leverage within tax-advantaged accounts. However, consider the financing cost and ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and timeline.

### Can I have both traditional and Roth IRAs with Basic Capital?

Yes, you can maintain separate Basic Capital accounts for both traditional and Roth IRAs, each with their respective contribution limits and tax treatments.

### What happens at retirement?

At retirement, you can continue holding your investments or begin systematic withdrawals following IRA distribution rules. The Basic Capital financing structure remains in place unless you choose to pay down the financing balance.

### Is there an age limit for Basic Capital?

You must be at least 18 years old to open an account. There's no upper age limit, but traditional IRA required minimum distributions begin at age 73, which may affect your investment strategy.

### Can I add more money later?

Yes, you can make additional contributions up to annual IRA limits. Each contribution receives the same 4:1 financing ratio, allowing you to gradually increase your investment power over time.

### What if I lose my job?

Job loss doesn't directly affect your Basic Capital IRA. However, you may lose access to employer 401(k) contributions. Consider rolling over your 401(k) to an IRA to maintain investment continuity.
