# Basic Capital FAQ


## General Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Who is a good fit for Basic Capital?</strong></summary>

Basic Capital is built for long-term investors seeking broad market exposure and tax-advantaged growth. The financing is designed to remain in place for the duration of your investment and does not require scheduled repayment, allowing you to stay focused on long-term compounding.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is Basic Capital available outside of an IRA or 401(k)?</strong></summary>

No, Basic Capital is designed for long-term investing. As a result it is exclusively offered within an IRA or 401(k) to maximize tax efficiency for long-term investors.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is Basic Capital different from a margin loan?</strong></summary>

Basic Capital is not a margin loan but it is important to understand how Basic Capital financing differs from traditional margin lending.

Basic Capital offers $4 of financing for every $1 you contribute, but only on eligible assets — broad market stocks and bonds intended to be held for the long-term. The financing is also long-term, and not subject to mark-to-market liquidation.

Alternatively, margin loans are extended on a 2:1 basis, $2 dollars of assets for every $1 of equity, and have constant mark-to-market risk. If the value of your assets drop, your account can be liquidated.

Margin rates are between 4.50-6% and brokers typically do not restrict which assets you can purchase. Margin provides relatively low cost of financing and investing flexibility, but with limited investment power and the risk of forced liquidation.

Basic Capital financing is currently 6.25% and can only be secured with eligible assets, but provides substantially more investing power without the risk of marked-to-market liquidation.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is the financing rate floating? Is there interest rate risk?</strong></summary>

Yes, the financing rate floats with short-term interest rates, specifically the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (SOFR) plus 200 basis points (currently 6.25%).

That means the cost of financing in Basic Capital can go up or down, but the underlying bond investments are also floating rate with spreads greater than 200 basis points. Because you are earning more than you owe, it reduces your direct interest rate exposure, even if the cost of Basic Capital financing goes up.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>When and how is the financing paid back?</strong></summary>

The investments in your account earn more income than you owe in financing costs. The extra income is re-invested, earning income and benefitting from long-term exposure to the market.

Over time, the income and gains in your account reduce the level of financing relative to your equity. Similar to a home mortgage, the longer you stay invested, the initial financing becomes smaller relative to the accrued value in Basic Capital.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What are the biggest risks with Basic Capital?</strong></summary>

Because Basic Capital is not marked-to-market or subject to forced liquidation from declines in value, the biggest risk is liquidating your account during a period of market distress.

Should you decide to liquidate your account when asset values are down, proceeds would go first to paying back the financing, and you would get the remaining. If the value of assets in your account were worth less than the financing, you would not receive any proceeds, but your other assets and outside retirement investments are completely protected.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Am I personally liable for the financing?</strong></summary>

Your Basic Capital investment is wrapped in a Limited Liability Company (LLC.), limiting your losses only to what you have contributed. Your outside assets and retirement funds are completely protected.

Your personal assets are protected due to the limited liability of the entity that secures the financing.

If you were to liquidate your account during a period of extreme market distress, it is possible you could lose the entire value of your account, but your losses would be limited to what you contributed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does the financing count towards my annual contribution limits?</strong></summary>

No, Basic Capital's additional financing does not count towards annual contribution limits.
